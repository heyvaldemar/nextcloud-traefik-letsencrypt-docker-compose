# Nextcloud with Let's Encrypt Using Docker Compose

[![Deployment Verification](https://github.com/heyvaldemar/nextcloud-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose/actions/workflows/00-deployment-verification.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/heyvaldemar/nextcloud-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose/actions)

The badge displayed on my repository indicates the status of the deployment verification workflow as executed on the latest commit to the main branch.

**Passing**: This means the most recent commit has successfully passed all deployment checks, confirming that the Docker Compose setup functions correctly as designed.

üìô The complete installation guide is available on my [website](https://www.heyvaldemar.com/install-nextcloud-using-docker-compose/).

‚ùó Change variables in the `.env` to meet your requirements.

üí° Note that the `.env` file should be in the same directory as `nextcloud-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml`.

Create networks for your services before deploying the configuration using the commands:

`docker network create traefik-network`

`docker network create nextcloud-network`

Deploy Nextcloud using Docker Compose:

`docker compose -f nextcloud-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml -p nextcloud up -d`

## Background Jobs Using Cron

To ensure your Nextcloud instance operates efficiently, it's important to use the "Cron" method to execute background jobs. A dedicated Docker container has already been set up in your environment to handle these tasks.

### Steps to Enable Cron:

1. **Log in to Nextcloud as an Administrator.**
2. Go to **Administration settings** (click on your user profile in the top right corner and select "Administration settings").
3. In the **Administration** section on the left sidebar, select **Basic settings**.
4. Scroll down to the **Background jobs** section.
5. Select the **"Cron (Recommended)"** option.

### Why Use Cron?

The "Cron" method ensures that background tasks, such as file indexing, notifications, and cleanup operations, run at regular intervals independently of user activity. This method is more reliable and efficient than AJAX or Webcron, particularly for larger or more active instances, as it does not depend on users accessing the site to trigger these tasks. With the dedicated container in your setup, this method keeps your Nextcloud instance responsive and in good health by running these jobs consistently.

## Backups

The `backups` container in the configuration is responsible for the following:

1. **Database Backup**: Creates compressed backups of the PostgreSQL database using pg_dump.
Customizable backup path, filename pattern, and schedule through variables like `POSTGRES_BACKUPS_PATH`, `POSTGRES_BACKUP_NAME`, and `BACKUP_INTERVAL`.

2. **Application Data Backup**: Compresses and stores backups of the application data on the same schedule. Controlled via variables such as `DATA_BACKUPS_PATH`, `DATA_BACKUP_NAME`, and `BACKUP_INTERVAL`.

3. **Backup Pruning**: Periodically removes backups exceeding a specified age to manage storage. Customizable pruning schedule and age threshold with `POSTGRES_BACKUP_PRUNE_DAYS` and `DATA_BACKUP_PRUNE_DAYS`.

By utilizing this container, consistent and automated backups of the essential components of your instance are ensured. Moreover, efficient management of backup storage and tailored backup routines can be achieved through easy and flexible configuration using environment variables.

## nextcloud-restore-database.sh Description

This script facilitates the restoration of a database backup:

1. **Identify Containers**: It first identifies the service and backups containers by name, finding the appropriate container IDs.

2. **List Backups**: Displays all available database backups located at the specified backup path.

3. **Select Backup**: Prompts the user to copy and paste the desired backup name from the list to restore the database.

4. **Stop Service**: Temporarily stops the service to ensure data consistency during restoration.

5. **Restore Database**: Executes a sequence of commands to drop the current database, create a new one, and restore it from the selected compressed backup file.

6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the restoration is completed.

To make the `nextcloud-restore-database.sh` script executable, run the following command:

`chmod +x nextcloud-restore-database.sh`

Usage of this script ensures a controlled and guided process to restore the database from an existing backup.

## nextcloud-restore-application-data.sh Description

This script is designed to restore the application data:

1. **Identify Containers**: Similarly to the database restore script, it identifies the service and backups containers by name.

2. **List Application Data Backups**: Displays all available application data backups at the specified backup path.

3. **Select Backup**: Asks the user to copy and paste the desired backup name for application data restoration.

4. **Stop Service**: Stops the service to prevent any conflicts during the restore process.

5. **Restore Application Data**: Removes the current application data and then extracts the selected backup to the appropriate application data path.

6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the application data has been successfully restored.

To make the `nextcloud-restore-application-data.sh` script executable, run the following command:

`chmod +x nextcloud-restore-application-data.sh`

By utilizing this script, you can efficiently restore application data from an existing backup while ensuring proper coordination with the running service.

## Disabling Skeleton Directory for New Users

New Nextcloud users typically receive default files and folders upon account creation, which are sourced from the skeleton directory. Disabling this feature can be useful to provide a clean start for users and reduce disk usage. Use the `occ config:system:set` command to set the skeleton directory path to an empty string, effectively disabling the default content for new users.

List all running containers to find the one running Nextcloud:

`docker ps`

Run the command below, replacing `nextcloud-container-name` with your container's name. Adjust `33` to the correct user ID if different:

`docker exec -u 33 -it nextcloud-container-name php occ config:system:set skeletondirectory --value=''`

## Fixing Database Index Issues

Your Nextcloud database might be missing some indexes. This situation can occur because adding indexes to large tables can take considerable time, so they are not added automatically. Running `occ db:add-missing-indices` manually allows these indexes to be added while the instance continues running. Adding these indexes can significantly speed up queries on tables like `filecache` and `systemtag_object_mapping`, which might be missing indexes such as `fs_storage_path_prefix` and `systag_by_objectid`.

List all running containers to find the one running Nextcloud:

`docker ps`

Run the command below, replacing `nextcloud-container-name` with your container's name. Adjust `33` to the correct user ID if different:

`docker exec -u 33 -it nextcloud-container-name php occ db:add-missing-indices`

Confirm the indices were added by checking the status:

`docker exec -u 33 -it nextcloud-container-name php occ status`

- Operations on large databases can take time; consider scheduling during low-usage periods.
- Always backup your database before making changes.

## Rescanning Files

When files are added directly to Nextcloud's data directory through methods other than the web interface or sync clients (e.g., via FTP or direct server access), they are not automatically visible in the Nextcloud user interface. This happens because these files bypass Nextcloud's normal indexing process.

To make all manually added files visible in the UI, you can use the `occ files:scan` command to update Nextcloud's file index. This command should be used with care as it can impact server performance, especially on larger installations.

List all running containers to find the one running Nextcloud:

`docker ps`

Run the command below, replacing `nextcloud-container-name` with your container's name. Adjust `33` to the correct user ID if different:

`docker exec -u 33 -it nextcloud-container-name php occ files:scan --all`

- Be aware that this command can significantly affect performance during its execution. It is advisable to run this scan during periods of low user activity.
- Always ensure that you have up-to-date backups before performing any operations that affect the filesystem or database.
